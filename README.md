# [hexy][]

Fast, flexible hexadecimal pretty-printing.  This repo is the companion to the Writing Performant Haskell blog post series and is a work-in-progress.  The package will be iterated on throughout the blog post series to make it speedy.  It is intended to serve as a guide to a few of the optimization approaches we can take as Haskellers.
